This repository contains the figures and report for my master's disseration, *Composite Polynomial Approximations to the Sign and Sqrt Functions*, at the University of Oxford. All code snippets used to make the figures were written in $\text{MATLAB}$ and leveraged the [`chebfun`](https://www.chebfun.org/) package, allowing easy visualisation of polynomial approximants, their error functions, and their equioscillation points.
