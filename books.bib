%abstract = "A globally convergent matrix algorithm is presented for finding the real and complex zeros of a (complex) polynomial p(x). A combination of Schmeisser's and Fiedler's matrices is used in the algorithm. First, the greatest common divisor, g(x), of p(x) and its derivative, p′(x), is obtained and used to reduce p(x) to a polynomial q(x) = p(x)q(x) with simple zeros. Second, the zeros of q(x) are computed either by finding the eigenvalues of the first block of Schmeisser's matrix or by applying Fiedler's algorithm recursively. In either case, the eigenvalues are obtained by the QR algorithm. Third, the multiplicity of each zero of p(x) is calculated by means of Lagouanelle's modified limiting formula. Sample numerical results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm."

%abstract="In solving a mathematical problem numerically, we frequently need to operate on a vector $\upsilon$ by an operator that can be expressed asf(A), whereA is anN {\texttimes}N matrix [e.g., exp(A), sin(A), A−-]. Except for very simple matrices, it is impractical to construct the matrixf (A) explicitly. Usually an approximation to it is used. This paper develops an algorithm based upon a polynomial approximation tof (A). First the problem is reduced to a problem of approximatingf (z) by a polynomial in z, where z belongs to a domainD in the complex plane that includes all the eigenvalues ofA. This approximation problem is treated by interpolatingf (z) in a certain set of points that is known to have some maximal properties. The approximation thus achieved is ``almost best.'' Implementing the algorithm to some practical problems is described. Since a solution to a linear systemAx=b isx=A−1b, an iterative solution algorithm can be based upon a polynomial approximation tof (A)=A−1. We give special attention to this important problem.",

It differs from the usual Newton method by a multiplicative factor at each step. This multiplier halves the relative error by translating the usual one-sided error curve into a two-sided one, and then adjusting to make a Moursund-like fit. The generalized logarithmic error is used in determining this set of factors.},

Two widely-quoted matrix square root iterations obtained by rewriting this Newton iteration are shown to have excellent mathematical convergence properties. However, by means of a perturbation analysis and supportive numerical examples, it is shown that these simplified iterations are numerically unstable. A further variant of Newton's method for the matrix square root, recently proposed in the literature, is shown to be, for practical purposes, numerically stable.},

The problem arises of determining a stochastic pth root of a stochastic matrix (the given transition matrix). By exploiting the theory of functions of matrices, we develop results on the existence and characterization of matrix pth roots, and in particular on the existence of stochastic pth roots of stochastic matrices. Our contributions include characterization of when a real matrix has a real pth root, a classification of pth roots of a possibly singular matrix, a sufficient condition for a pth root of a stochastic matrix to have unit row sums, and the identification of two classes of stochastic matrices that have stochastic pth roots for all p. We also delineate a wide variety of possible configurations as regards existence, nature (primary or nonprimary), and number of stochastic roots, and develop a necessary condition for existence of a stochastic root in terms of the spectrum of the given matrix."
